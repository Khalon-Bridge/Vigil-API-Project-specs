## Feature: Hybrid API with GraphQL Core
This API design leverages the GraphQL schema as the central mechanism for defining the data model and operations, ensuring consistency and reusability. The architecture exposes both RESTful and GraphQL endpoints to accommodate various client preferences and use cases. REST endpoints translate queries to GraphQL queries internally, allowing for a single source of truth for data interactions and leveraging GraphQL's strengths in querying and mutation efficiency. This hybrid approach provides clients with the flexibility to choose their preferred interaction model while simplifying backend maintenance and scalability. Benefits include enhanced developer experience, optimized network usage through GraphQL's query-batching and tailored responses, and REST's widespread familiarity and tooling support.
